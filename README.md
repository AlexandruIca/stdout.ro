# Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, you need [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed.
Other than that, fork this repo and just open a PR with your new content, and Netlify should
build a preview of the new content.

Making a new post:

```
hugo new posts/name-of-the-post.md
```

Seeing the results (with drafts included) locally:

```
hugo server -D
```

(You can see more details [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)).

Don't forget to mark your posts as `draft: false`, otherwise they won't be shown in the final build.
